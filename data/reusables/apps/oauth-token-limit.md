There is a limit of ten tokens that are issued per user/application/scope combination, with a maximum rate limit of ten tokens created per hour. If an application creates more than ten tokens for the same user and the same scopes, the oldest tokens with the same user/application/scope combination are revoked. However, hitting the hourly rate limit will not revoke your oldest token. After the hour has passed, you will be able to create a token again, and by doing so your oldest token will be revoked.
